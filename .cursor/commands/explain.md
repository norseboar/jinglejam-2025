# Explain

Provide clear, structured explanations of files, code, architecture, or technical concepts. Break complex topics into digestible sections, present incrementally, adapt based on feedback.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. **Check project context first**
   - Review relevant files, documentation, and related code
   - Understand the current project state
   - Identify what specifically needs explanation

2. **Ask clarifying questions only if needed**
   - If something is genuinely ambiguous, ask ONE question
   - Example: If user asks "How is state stored?" but there are multiple state systems, ask which one they mean
   - If the prompt is clear, skip straight to explaining

### Step 2: Present the Explanation

1. **Break into sections of 200-300 words each**
   - Present one section at a time
   - After each section, ask: "Does this make sense so far?"
   - Cover: purpose, how it works, key concepts, relationships to other parts

2. **Adapt based on feedback**
   - If the user needs more detail, dive deeper
   - If something is unclear, rephrase or provide examples
   - If they understand quickly, you can move faster

### Step 3: After the Explanation

**Summary (if helpful):**

- Offer to create a brief summary document if the explanation was complex
- Ask if there are related topics they'd like explained next

## Key Principles

- **Start explaining immediately** - Assume the prompt is clear and go straight into the explanation
- **Ask questions only when needed** - Only clarify if something is genuinely unclear or ambiguous
- **Incremental presentation** - Present explanation in sections, validate each
- **Wait for feedback** - Ask after each section whether it makes sense so far
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
- **Adapt depth** - Match the level of detail to what the user needs

## Example

User: "Explain how the game engine works"

You: [Check relevant files, then start explaining]

"The game engine manages the core game state and flow. Here's how it works:

[First section - 200-300 words covering main concepts]

Does this make sense so far?"

[Wait for feedback, then continue with next section]
