# Docs Workflow Guide

Use this guide to locate reference docs, project plans, and working notes. It also outlines the naming conventions and plan format used across the project.

## Directory Layout

- `docs/index.md` – Entry point with a quick map of high-priority docs (vision, projects, plans).
- `docs/long-term/` – Durable reference material such as `gdd.md`, design notes, tech stack decisions.
- `docs/projects/` – One folder per project-scale effort (`project-name/`) containing the project plan and supporting artifacts.
- `docs/plans/` – Implementation plans for standalone features or work that doesn't belong to a specific project. Use dated filenames (`YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`).
- `docs/archive/` _(optional)_ – Completed projects or retired notes kept for historical reference.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase kebab-case for files and directories (`tech-stack.md`, `2025-11-08-ui-refactor.md`, `project-alpha/plan.md`).
- Stable references: locate them in `docs/long-term/` with concise descriptive names.
- Implementation plans:
  - **For existing projects**: Save to `docs/projects/project-name/plan.md`
  - **For standalone work**: Save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
- Projects: `docs/projects/project-name/plan.md` serves as the primary plan file; supporting files are named by purpose (`tasks.md`, `bugs.md`, `2025-11-10-research.md`).

## Plan Format

All plans follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Name] Plan

**Goal:** One sentence.

---

## Status

- [ ] Task/Milestone 1
- [ ] Task/Milestone 2

---

## Summary

**Task 1:** One-line description.
**Task 2:** One-line description.

---

## Tasks (or Milestones)

[Detailed breakdown]

---

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

**Two plan types:**

- **Project plans** — High-level orchestration (milestones, deliverables). See `write-project-plan` command.
- **Code plans** — Detailed LLM execution (step-by-step). See `write-code-plan` command.

## Plan Creation Checklist

1. Create the file in `docs/projects/` or `docs/plans/` using the naming rules above.
2. Start with **Goal** (one sentence) and **Status** (checkbox list at top).
3. Add **Summary** section with one-line descriptions of each task/milestone.
4. Add **Tasks** or **Milestones** section with detailed breakdown.
5. Add **Exit Criteria** with checkbox list of validation gates.
6. Update checkboxes as work progresses; add inline status notes when helpful (`- [x] migrate layout (done 2025-11-08)`).
7. Cross-link related long-term docs, projects, or plans for context.
8. Surface the plan in `docs/index.md` so other contributors can find it quickly.
9. When complete, mark the status, consider moving to `docs/archive/`, and promote any enduring lessons into `docs/long-term/`.

## Testing and Debugging Guidance

- Verify changes manually by running the game and testing the relevant functionality
- Use print statements and the debugger to understand behavior
- When running into issues, ask the user to test specific scenarios and report results
- Focus on manual verification through gameplay, not automated tests (see `tests.mdc`)

## Quick Reference

- Long-term references → `docs/long-term/`
- Project plans → `docs/projects/project-name/plan.md`
- Standalone plans → `docs/plans/`
- Archive → `docs/archive/`
- Execution → `execute-plan` command + `core-rules.mdc`
