# Core Rules

Three non-negotiable rules when executing plans.

## 1. Follow the Plan Exactly

Do not deviate or improvise. The plan was written deliberately. If something seems wrong, stop and ask—don't "fix" it yourself.

## 2. Stop After Each Step

After completing any step, STOP. Report what you did. Wait for confirmation before continuing. Do not batch multiple steps together.

## 3. Don't Guess

When uncertain—especially about product behavior or requirements—STOP and ask. The right answer is never to guess. Say "I don't know how this should behave" and wait for guidance.

**If you catch yourself thinking:**

- "I'll just do this next part too" → STOP. Rule 2.
- "This probably should be..." → STOP. Rule 3.
- "The plan says X but I think Y is better" → STOP. Rule 1.
