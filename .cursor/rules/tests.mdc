# Testing Policy

**We are not writing or maintaining tests in this project.**

We are moving very fast and tests won't provide much value in this environment. Focus on rapid development and iteration instead of test coverage.

IT IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT TO VERIFY THAT CHANGES WORK AS EXPECTED. To do this, stop and ask the user to verify changes. Describe the behavior to test.

## What This Means

- Do not write new tests
- Do not fix existing tests
- Do not run tests as part of development workflow
- Focus on manual testing and rapid iteration
- When something should be verified, stop and ask the user to verify
